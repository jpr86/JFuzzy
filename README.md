Java Fuzzy Logic

JFuzzy is a fuzzy logic library in java that facilitates the developmentof fuzzy inference systems.  It supports the use of 
Fuzzy Control Language (FCL), and works with JEvolve to automatically generate fuzzy inference systems and controllers.

Building a fuzzy controller requires creation of a RuleBase, and then adding rules to the RuleBase. A rule is composed of 
conditions for firing the rule and conclusions that result from firing the rule. Conditions may be complex and constructed 
using And and Or operators.  In addition, input/output variables and their membership functions determine the degree to which 
conditions are satisfied. For a more detailed tutorial, consult one of the many excellent ones on fuzzy logic
available on the internet.
