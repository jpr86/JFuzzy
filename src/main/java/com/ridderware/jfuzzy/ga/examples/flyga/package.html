        Example of using a genetic algorithm to automatically generate a fuzzy 
        logic controller for an airplane.
        
        <p>This example attempts to use a GA to automatically generate a fuzzy rule-set
            for setting the roll angle of an aircraft based on the angle-of-arrival of a 
            signal.  Copy the shell scripts (*.sh) to the distribution root (the directory
            containing jfuzzy.jar) and cd to that directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            To execute the GA (on Linux):
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>sh flygaMain.sh</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This will use fly.fcl to set up the problem (declaring variables, their domains,
            and membership functions).  The GA will output the best individual as
            bestfly.fcl.  
        </p>
        <p>
            To see the effectiveness of the result:
        </p>
        <code>sh flyTest.sh</code>
        <p>
            This will generate the file "output" which plots the roll angle (column 2) versus
            the angle of arrival (column 1).  Use gnuplot to visualize as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>gnuplot</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>> plot 'output' using 1:2, x/3</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The straight line represents a perfect solution.
